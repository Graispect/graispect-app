# graispect – ios social app (in development)

a private, friends-only social app built around comfort, presence,  
and creating a space without algorithms, explore pages, or endless doom scrolling.

this project reflects my design thinking, my creative vision,  
and my need for an app that feels human.

### what i worked on

- designed the ui using figma and sketch.
- created all icons manually in procreate. 
- built the app from scratch using swiftui.
- implemented custom interaction flows.
- built the posting system (glimpses, moods, thoughts, tunes, daily questions).
- designed and deployed the app’s landing page (html, css, js).

### why it’s private

the app is still in development and contains original ux concepts  
that i'd like to keep confidential until launch.  
no code or full demo is public yet (unless i hand you my laptop & my phone).
