# graispect — iOS social app

a private, friends-only social app built around comfort, presence,  
and creating a space without algorithms, explore pages, or endless doom scrolling.

---

## concept

this project reflects my design thinking, my creative vision,  
and my need for an app that feels human.

### what i worked on

- designed the ui using figma and sketch.
- created all icons manually in procreate. 
- built the app from scratch using swiftui.
- implemented custom interaction flows.
- built the posting system (glimpses, moods, thoughts, tunes, daily questions).
- designed and deployed the app’s landing page (html, css, js).

the repository is public for visibility, but implementation details are intentionally limited,
no code or full demo is public yet (unless i hand you my laptop & my phone).
